Test ideas:


Branches:
- Branch-link not-taken does not update LR, does not branch
-- But does update CTR if required


Faults:
- in shadow of branch T/NT
- in shadow of isync
- LD faults, and instruction in IF at the time of the LD in MEM also causes an ifetch fault (take only the LD fault)
- on next page
- exception with store in shadow (no store!)

Synchronisation issues:
- icbi and isync
- mtmsr w/ DR/IR change in shadow
- TLBI and ptesync (guarantee new transls are visible)
- BATs


Exceptions:

*	{Branch, SVC, IRQ, DEC} at 0ffc,0ff8,0ff4, 0ff0 where page 1000 faults; do not see fault
*	Memory fault at 0ffc,0ff8,0ff4, 0ff0 where page 100 faults.  See mem fault only.

- Store in shadow of branch or exception (SVC, older ld/st fault) doesn't affect memory.
